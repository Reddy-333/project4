        <h1>LEE MIN HO</h1>
        <p>
            Lee Min-ho (Korean: 이민호; Hanja: 李敏鎬, born June 22, 1987)[2] is a South Korean actor, singer, model, creative director[3] and businessman.[4] He gained widespread fame worldwide with his role as Gu Jun-pyo in Boys Over Flowers (2009) which also earned him the Best New Actor award at the 45th Baeksang Arts Awards. His notable lead roles in television series include Personal Taste (2010), City Hunter (2011), Faith (2012), The Heirs (2013), The Legend of the Blue Sea (2016). In 2020 he starred in Studio Dragon's The King: Eternal Monarch, which grossed US$135 million.[5] Apart from his television career, Lee featured in the first lead role in the film Gangnam Blues (2015). This was followed by his first China-produced film Bounty Hunters (2016), and the mini-romance-web-series Line Romance (2014), both collectively grossed US$51 million.
The success of Lee's television series established him as a top Hallyu star;[7][8] he is the most followed South Korean actor on social media.[9] Lee became the first Korean celebrity to have a wax figure made in his image at Madame Tussauds, with figures being unveiled in Shanghai in 2013,[10] and Hong Kong in 2014.[11] He earns US$2.5 million from product endorsements alone.
Early life and education:
Lee Min-ho was born on June 22, 1987, in Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul. Raised by Buddhist parents, he is the younger one of their two children.[12] As a child, Lee initially hoped to become a professional football player.
While attending Namseong Elementary School (서울남성초등학교), he was selected for the junior football class of manager and ex-professional player Cha Bum-kun. However, an injury during fifth grade put an end to his aspiration.[13] Also beginning from when he was in Namseong, other pupils would joke and call Lee names. In a 2009 interview with the Asia Business Daily, he recalled his friends there nicknaming him kkamdungi (깜둥이; lit. 'darkie') in reference to his tan skin. Other nicknames were 'skeleton' from his time at Banpo Middle School (반포중학교) and 'demon' in high school—the former stemmed from the thought that he was "too skinny" whereas the latter nickname was what his "playful" personality earned him.
By his first year at Danggok High School (당곡고등학교), Lee had already turned his interests to acting and modeling. After he posed for a few magazines, he met the future president of Starhaus Entertainment coincidentally.[14] The encounter would fuel his newly professional career as an actor,[14] and he would ultimately sign with the agency in 2005.
In 2006, Lee enrolled at Konkuk University. In the university's College of Art and Design, he began majoring in Film Arts,[14] for which he has since gotten a bachelor's degree.[13] He is currently pursuing his master's degree in Film at Kookmin University Graduate School.
career
2002–2008: Beginnings
Lee started auditioning and landed minor roles in several television shows such as Romance, Nonstop and Recipe of Love. His official debut (main) role was in an EBS series, Secret Campus (2006).[14] Early in his career, Lee went by the stage name Lee Min because his agency thought his birth name was too ordinary. However, as his stage name was pronounced and written in the same way as the Korean word "imin", which means "immigration", he later said it was difficult to find himself in internet search results. He eventually went back to using his original name.
In 2006, his acting career was put on hold for a year following a serious car wreck, which occurred while riding in the back of a car with fellow actor Jung Il-woo. Their two friends riding in the front seat were killed instantly.[17] Lee was severely injured and spent several months bedridden.[13][18] Upon recovery, Lee received his first leading role in the high-school drama Mackerel Run in 2007, but the series was reduced to only eight episodes due to low viewership ratings.[19] In 2008, he appeared in various roles on television (dramas Get Up and I Am Sam) and two movies, Public Enemy Returns and Our School's E.T.. During the shooting of the latter, he became good friends with actor Kim Su-ro. Kim later gave him praise on a variety show called Win Win: "I recognize a star when I see one. When I was doing Our School's E.T., I knew that Lee Min-ho would become one of the top actors in the country".
